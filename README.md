# Batching Transactions using smart contract and web3js

## What Is Batch Transactions?

Batch transactions is the processing of transactions in a group or batch. This differentiates batch transaction from single transaction, which involves processing one hash at a time with batch of transactions.

## Advantages of Batch Transactions

Faster and Lower Cost

## Applications

While batch transactions can be carried out at when, it's particularly suited to end-of-cycle processing, such as for processing a bank's reports at the end of a day or generating monthly or biweekly payrolls.

## Steps for Implementing

you need to create an npm project by going to an empty folder, running ```npm init```, and following its instructions. You can use another package manager, like yarn, but we recommend you use npm 7 or later, as it makes installing Hardhat plugins simpler.

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
