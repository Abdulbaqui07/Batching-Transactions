# Batching Transactions using smart contract and web3js

## What Is Batch Transactions?

Batch transactions is the processing of transactions in a group or batch. This differentiates batch transaction from single transaction, which involves processing one hash at a time with batch of transactions.

## Advantages of Batch Transactions

Faster and Lower Cost

## Applications

While batch transactions can be carried out at when, it's particularly suited to end-of-cycle processing, such as for processing a bank's reports at the end of a day or generating monthly or biweekly payrolls.

## Steps for Implementing

You need to create an npm project by going to an empty folder, running ```npm init -y```, and following its instructions. You can use another package manager, like yarn, but I recommend you to use npm 7 or later, as it makes installing Hardhat plugins simpler.

Once your project is ready, you should run

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

To create the sample project, run npx hardhat in your project folder:
```
$ npx hardhat
```
